### Linear regression of pI-axis  
### Logarithmic regression of Mr-axis  

For the calibration of pI | Mr-axes you can use manually given pI | Mr-values and distances  or data stored in an external EXCEL-file. 
Templates of EXCEL-file (.xlsx) and  2-DE Gel Image  (.png) can be found on Github.
You can download the regression plot as a (.png) using the camera sign of plotly-functionalities visible by moving the mouse up above the regression curve.   
The R-code is given on  <a href="https://github.com/kppleissner/GelCali/" target="_blank"> GitHub</a>.
